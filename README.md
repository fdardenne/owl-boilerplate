# Owl + Tailwind boilerplate
This repository defines a boilerplate to launch an owl project with tailwind and the Vite bundler.

This boilerplate is mainly used for my personal projects and to learn. 
However, you are free to contribute to this repo by opening issues or PR.

## Installing

Clone this repository or use it as a GitHub template.

Install the dependencies

You can now start a development server with hot reload.
`npm run dev`

## Testing

Components are testable thanks to `vitest` (https://vitest.dev/guide/)

## Build

If you want to put your frontend in production, you must build the project

You will find the built files in the `dist/` folder
